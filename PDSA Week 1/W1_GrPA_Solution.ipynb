The function should return this minimum difference value.\n",

        "### **Step-by-Step Logic for `find_Min_Difference` Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Start:\n",
        "   - The function begins by accepting two inputs: a list `L` and an integer `P`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Sort the List:\n",
        "   - The list `L` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in finding the subsets where the difference between the largest and smallest elements is minimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Set `N` to `P` and `M` to the Length of `L`:\n",
        "   - The value of `P` is assigned to a variable `N`.\n",
        "   - The length of the list `L` is stored in `M`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Initialize `min_diff`:\n",
        "   - `min_diff` is initialized to the maximum possible difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `L`. This sets a baseline for comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Finding Minimum Difference:\n",
        "   - The loop runs from 0 to `M - N` (inclusive). This ensures we can access the last element of a subset of size N without going out of bounds.\n",
        "   - Inside the loop, the difference between the maximum `(L[i + N - 1])` and minimum `(L[i])` values of the current subset of size P is calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Updating Minimum Difference:\n",
        "   - If the current difference is smaller than the previously recorded `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` to this new smaller value.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Loop from `i = 0` to `M - N`:\n",
        "   - A loop is initiated, starting from `i = 0` and running until `M - N`. This loop checks every possible subset of size `P`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. Compare the Difference:\n",
        "   - For each subset of size `P`, the difference between the largest element (`L[i + N - 1]`) and the smallest element (`L[i]`) is calculated.\n",
        "   - If the calculated difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`, `min_diff` is updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. End Loop:\n",
        "   - The loop continues until all possible subsets are checked, ensuring that the smallest difference has been found.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. Return the Result:\n",
        "   - The function returns `min_diff`, which now holds the smallest difference between the maximum and minimum values of any subset of size `P`.\n",
